# Therapeutic Refactoring

Code samples for the talk Therapeutic Refactoring.

## XYZ Service

This is the main example in the talk.

Each step in the process of first adding characterization tests
and then refactoring has been committed separately.

## Codejunk

A loan word from the field of information design, inspired by Edward Tufte's
term _chartjunk_.

### Lousy Comments

* comments that state the obvious
* comments that echo the implementation
* comments that are wrong
* comments that are imprecise
* comments that are misspelled

### Explicit Return

Mostly explicit returns are worthless.

Obviously, there are exceptions, such as with guard clauses.

### Trailing Whitespace

Ugly and messy. Editors can (and should) be configured to show you this.

### Commented Out Code

Don't let the rotting decay ruin your perfectly good codebase.
